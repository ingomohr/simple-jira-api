## What is This?
Simple API to read information from Jira

### Features
- âœ… Read versions
- âœ… Read released versions in a certain time window
- âœ… Read issues for a given JQL query
- âœ… Read issues for a given fix version

### How does it Work?
* Connects to a Jira instance via HTTPS (uses simple authorization).
* Calls REST end points on the Jira instance
* Automatically closes the connection afterwards

### Requirements
- Java 17 JRE installed (or newer)
- Access to some Jira instance
  - (tested on Jira Server 8.22.6 and Jira Cloud)

### How to Build
- You need Maven installed (e.g. 3.8.6)

On your terminal run:
```
mvn clean install
```
ðŸ’¡ _This also builds the JAR-with-dependencies_

### Examples
#### Read all Issues from Project
_Please note that the example requires an API token to be generated at the given user's account. For Jira Server instances, the user password can be used, too._

```Java
String user = "myName@sampleMail.com";
String apiToken = "123Fly";
String jiraInstance = "https://my-name.atlassian.net/";

String jql = "project = MYPROJ ORDER BY Rank ASC";

JiraAccessConfig config = new JiraAccessConfig(jiraInstance, user, apiToken);
JiraIssuesForJqlProvider provider = new JiraIssuesForJqlProvider();
List<Issue> issues = provider.getIssues(config, jql);
```
